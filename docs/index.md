## what it do

My "blog" project to publish my notes from studies on the Implementing Cisco Service Provider Advanced Routing Solutions v1.1 (SPRI 300-510) to re-certify my CCNP that expires soon.

Ideally this will be a sub-project within a larger blog or website of my own. Much of it, the navigation, fonts, colors, and overall design are v0.1, and I don't really like it but I will focus on that later due to time crunch.
