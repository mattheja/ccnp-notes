## what it do

This is Matt's work in progress project to publish my notes and not use Microsoft OneNote like I did before. I dislike OneNote, greatly.

I am studying for Implementing Cisco Service Provider Advanced Routing Solutions v1.1 (SPRI 300-510) to re-certify my CCNP that expires soon.

Ideally this will be a sub-project within a larger blog or website of my own. Much of it, the navigation, fonts, colors, and overall design are v0.1, and I don't really like it but I will focus on that later due to time crunch.
